Introduction
=============

I've got a few days off over Christmas, so before the celebrations start I am going to quickly build something. The last few months I have spent a lot of time consulting and not much time building. Time to hack something cool together to see if I've still got it.

User story
----------

As a bored dude 
I want to build and document something cool
So that I can pass the time whilst practising my dev skills

Day 0 - 23:25
======
I'll start off bright and early tomorrow by rebuilding my dev environment. For now I'll just create this git repo and start off this blog. I'll be using pandoc to convert the markdown before publishing it somewhere.
